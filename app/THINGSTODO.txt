1. Some rules have not been coded:
- crucial: promotion of a pawn has not been coded
- rules for castling are incomplete; need to test that the king is not check on several tiles
- need to be able to:
  - offer a draw; 
  - accept a draw; 
  - resign
2. The game needs to be thoroughly tested and debugged
3. Styling: the games.html page needs work
  - add 2 icons: for accepting and rejecting game invitations
4. games.html: add a completed games category at the bottom
5. Optimize code: there are a LOT of queries SELECT COUNT(*) FROM moves. This can be made much more efficient. Should be done by "Game.get_by_game_id()".
6. Use flash messages if an invalid move is submitted; do some basic validations in javascript before allowing submit (e.g. check for valid vectors).
