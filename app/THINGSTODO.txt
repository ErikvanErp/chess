1. Some rules have not been coded:
- crucial: promotion of a pawn has not been coded
- rules for castling are incomplete; need to test that the king is not check on several tiles
- need to be able to:
  - offer a draw; 
  - accept a draw; 
  - resign
2. The game rules needs to be thoroughly tested and debugged
3. Styling: the games.html page needs work
  - add 2 icons: for accepting and rejecting game invitations
4. games.html: add a completed games category at the bottom

Known bugs:
1. check mate: app falsely signals check mate instead of check

for testing, use these board strings:
